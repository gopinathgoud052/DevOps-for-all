## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a transformative culture and practice that unites software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. By fostering collaboration and leveraging automation technologies, DevOps enables faster, more reliable code deployment to production in an efficient and repeatable manner.

## DevOps Model Defined:-

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. It aims to shorten the software development lifecycle and improve the quality and reliability of software releases.

## DevOps Life Cycle

DevOps is a practice that enables a single team to handle the whole application lifecycle, including development, testing, release, deployment, operation, display, and planning. It is a mix of the terms ‚ÄúDev‚Äù (for development) and ‚ÄúOps‚Äù (for operations). We can speed up the delivery of applications and services by a business with the aid of DevOps. Amazon, Netflix, and other businesses have all effectively embraced DevOps to improve their customer experience.

DevOps Lifecycle is the set of phases that includes DevOps for taking part in Development and Operation group duties for quicker software program delivery. DevOps follows positive techniques that consist of code, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, displaying, and planning. DevOps lifecycle follows a range of phases such as non-stop development, non-stop integration, non-stop testing, non-stop monitoring, and non-stop feedback. Each segment of the DevOps lifecycle is related to some equipment and applied sciences to obtain the process. Some of the frequently used tools are open source and are carried out primarily based on commercial enterprise requirements. DevOps lifecycle is effortless to manipulate and it helps satisfactory delivery.
