What is a Dockerfile?
The Dockerfile uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) and contains instructions for generating a Docker image. Dockerfile will define the processes to quickly produce an image. While creating your application, you should create a Dockerfile in order since the Docker daemon runs all of the instructions from top to bottom.

(The Docker daemon, often referred to simply as “Docker,” is a background service that manages Docker containers on a system.)

It is a text document that contains necessary commands which on execution help assemble a Docker Image.
Docker image is created using a Dockerfile.

Why to use Docker?
Docker can be used to pack the application and its dependencies which makes it lightweight and easy to ship the code faster with more reliability. Docker make its very simple to run the application in the production environment docker container can be platform independent if the docker engine is installed in the machine.

Resource Efficiency : Docker helps in maximizing the resource utilization by running the multiple containers on a single host. It helps in reducing the infrastructure costs and improves the efficiency.
Version Control: It simples the versioning for the applications and their dependencies ensuring the consistency and making easier of collaboration across the teams.
Microservices Agility: It enables the adoption of microservices architecture, promoting the scalability, flexibility and fault isolation agile application development.

Use Cases of Docker
The following are the some of the use cases of Docker:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) : It helps in streamlining and automating the software delivery process with ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
Microservices Architecture: It facilitates the development, deployment, and management of microservices with enabling independent scaling and maintenance.
Development Environment Consistency: It will ensures with consistent development, testing, and production environments, reducing “it works on my machine” issues.
Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Deployments: It helps in simplifying the application deployment across various cloud platforms, enhancing flexibility and reducing vendor lock-in.
