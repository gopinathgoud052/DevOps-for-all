** What is Kubernetes, and what are its key components? 
Answer: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that 
automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
applications. It allows developers to focus on building applications while 
handling the complexities of managing container lifecycles and infrastructure. 
Key Components: 
1. Control Plane: 
 > API Server: The front-end for Kubernetes that processes RESTful 
API requests. 
 >etcd: A distributed key-value store that holds cluster state and 
configuration. 
> Controller Manager: Handles core control loops like node 
controller, job controller, etc. 
> Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements 
and policies.
2. Worker Nodes:
> Kubelet: An agent that runs on nodes, ensures the desired state of
the containers, and communicates with the API server.
> Kube-proxy: Manages network routing and load balancing within
the cluster.
> Container Runtime: Executes the containers (e.g., Docker,
containerd, CRI-O).
3. Additional Components:
> Pods: The smallest deployable units, typically containing one or
more containers.
> Services: Expose applications running in pods to other pods or
external clients.
> ConfigMaps/Secrets: Store configuration data and sensitive
information, respectively.
> Volumes: Manage storage for persistent or ephemeral use.
**  What is a Pod in Kubernetes? Why is it important? 
Answer: A Pod is the smallest and simplest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It 
represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster and 
encapsulates one or more tightly coupled containers, along with shared storage 
and networking.
